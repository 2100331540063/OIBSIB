# Iris Dataset Classification

This repository contains code for training a machine learning model to classify iris flowers using the popular Iris dataset.

## Overview

The code provided here demonstrates how to:

- Load the Iris dataset using Pandas.
- Preprocess the data by separating features and target variables.
- Encode the categorical target variable into numerical values.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn.
- Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and classification report metrics.

## Requirements

To run the code, you'll need:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas

**Run the Code:**
    ```bash
    python iris_classification.py
    ```
**Explore the Results:**
    - Check the console for the model's accuracy.
    - View the classification report to understand the model's performance.

**File Structure**

- `iris.csv`: Dataset containing features and target variables.
- `iris_classification.py`: Python script implementing data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: You're currently reading .
